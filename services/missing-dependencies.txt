# AI Agent CPU Missing Dependencies

## Core Missing Dependencies (Required)
These were discovered through error messages and needed to be installed:

```bash
# Core Chinese language processing for Kokoro TTS international
ordered-set          # Required by misaki.transcription
pypinyin            # Required by misaki.transcription for Chinese phonetic conversion
cn2an               # Required by misaki.zh for Chinese number conversion
```

## Additional Recommended Dependencies
These may be needed for full functionality:

```bash
# Extended Chinese/multilingual support
opencc-python-reimplemented  # Traditional/Simplified Chinese conversion
jieba                       # Chinese text segmentation
misaki                     # Already installed, but listed for completeness

# Advanced multilingual TTS support
pangu                      # Chinese text formatting
zhconv                     # Chinese variant conversion
epitran                    # International Phonetic Alphabet conversion
num2words                  # Number to words conversion
inflect                    # English linguistic transformations
unidecode                  # Unicode to ASCII conversion
phonemizer                 # Text to phoneme conversion
gruut                      # Phoneme processing
espeak-ng                  # Text-to-speech synthesis engine
```

## Installation Commands Used

```bash
# Minimum required (installed during troubleshooting)
docker exec -it ai-agent-cpu pip install ordered-set
docker exec -it ai-agent-cpu pip install pypinyin
docker exec -it ai-agent-cpu pip install cn2an

# Full recommended set (optional)
docker exec -it ai-agent-cpu pip install \
    ordered-set \
    pypinyin \
    cn2an \
    opencc-python-reimplemented \
    jieba \
    pangu \
    zhconv \
    epitran \
    num2words \
    inflect \
    unidecode \
    phonemizer \
    gruut \
    espeak-ng
```

## Why These Are Needed

- **Kokoro TTS International Pipeline**: The service tries to use `kokoro_international` for non-English voices
- **Chinese Language Support**: Many dependencies are for Chinese text processing (pinyin, character conversion, etc.)
- **Missing from Base Image**: The `gyoridavid/ai-agents-no-code-tools:latest` image is missing these multilingual TTS dependencies

## Errors Encountered

1. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ordered_set'`
2. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pypinyin'`
3. `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cn2an'`

## Solution Status
✅ **Fixed**: Core dependencies installed
✅ **Working**: Kokoro TTS now functions with international voices
⚠️ **Temporary**: Dependencies installed at runtime (not persistent across container rebuilds)
