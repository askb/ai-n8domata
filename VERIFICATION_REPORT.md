|----------|----------|---------|
| `monitor` | `queue-metrics` | ✅ Renamed |
| `autoscaler` | `dynamic-scaler` | ✅ Renamed |

### ✅ Container Naming Standardized  

All containers now use `n8n-` prefix:

- `n8n-main`, `n8n-worker`, `n8n-webhook`
- `n8n-queue-metrics`, `n8n-dynamic-scaler`  
- `n8n-postgres`, `n8n-redis`, `n8n-traefik`
- All AI services: `n8n-ai-agent-cpu`, `n8n-short-video-maker-cpu`, etc.

### ✅ Dockerfile Improvements

- ✅ Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- ✅ Non-root user execution for security
- ✅ Health checks integrated
- ✅ Proper dependency caching

### ✅ Code Structure Improvements

- ✅ Modular Python architecture with config, clients, managers
- ✅ Pydantic configuration validation
- ✅ Error handling with exponential backoff
- ✅ Structured logging (being refined)
- ✅ Connection pooling and resource management

## 🚀 Performance Metrics

### Resource Usage (Current)

```
CPU Usage: Light load across all services
Memory Usage: ~8GB total for core services
Network: All internal communication functional
Storage: Data persistence verified
```

### Auto-Scaling Configuration
