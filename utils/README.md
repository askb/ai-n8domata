## Usage

Make scripts executable before running:

```bash
chmod +x utils/category/script-name.sh
./utils/category/script-name.sh
```

## Safety Notes

- Always review scripts before running them
- Most maintenance scripts require the services to be running
- Backup scripts should be run regularly
- GPU scripts are optimized for AMD RX 6800M hardware

## Environment Variables

Many scripts use these environment variables:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `POSTGRES_USER` - Database user
- `POSTGRES_DB` - Database name
- `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` - Docker Compose project name
